Realtimestagram
=========================

In modern apps it is popular to make your pictures look old. This project tries
to recreate the most popular \*stagram filters in VHDL. This is purely a learning project
to keep my VHDL up to date.

See the [documentation](http://benboz.github.io/realtimestagram)
or get the source on [Github](http://www.github.com/benboz/realtimestagram)
